"""
Pressing dashboard V4 -- FINAL simplified broadcast layout (2026-09-07
implementation pass). Same V4 data source as `render_pressing_dashboard_v4.py`
(`tactical_shared.snapshot.build_snapshot` / `pressing_v4.build_pressing_v4`,
evidence-aware FSM, both teams computed independently every frame) and the
same 2304x1204 canvas / video-output compatibility. This is the VISUAL
VALIDATION layer for Paper 1 (Pressing Structure Value & Optimization) --
it answers "why does the system think pressure is increasing?", not the
paper's scientific contribution itself.

LAYOUT: exactly two rows.
  ROW 1: tactical video feed (left) + pressing radar (right), both teams
         shown simultaneously, one compact state badge on the video only.
  ROW 2: exactly four graphs -- Press Intensity, Nearest Opponent
         Distance to Ball Carrier, Relative Closing Speed (signed, zero
         reference line), Numerical Support Around Ball Carrier (signed,
         step-style, zero reference line). Every graph carries a large
         title, an explicit X-axis label ("Match Time (seconds)"), an
         explicit Y-axis label with units, a one-line interpretation
         subtitle, and readable absolute-time tick labels -- a person who
         knows football but not this code should be able to read each
         graph unaided.

TWO TIME MODES:
  - "rolling" (default; what the final --out_path video uses): a
    trailing 20s window, tick labels at ABSOLUTE match-second values
    (e.g. at t=48s: 28s,32s,36s,40s,44s,48s), current-time cursor at the
    right edge.
  - "paper": the full 0-<duration>s clip, ticks every 30s, current-time
    cursor at its real position -- for static paper-figure/report use.
  Both modes only ever plot data up to the current frame (causal, no
  future-derived spoilers) and preserve real gaps for missing evidence
  -- no interpolation, no forward-fill, no event stitching, ever.

DATA LIMITATION (disclosed, not hidden): ball-carrier possession is only
resolved (`possession_state == 'CONTROLLED'`) in 144/3600 frames (4.0%)
of this clip -- every pressing graph is honestly this sparse because the
UPSTREAM possession-resolution feed is this sparse, not because of
anything in this renderer. Thresholds are not touched to make graphs
fuller.

Kept as a SEPARATE file from `render_pressing_dashboard_v4.py` (not an
in-place edit): that script produced the already-approved canonical
120s render and must stay reproducible exactly as before. No analytics
logic changes -- every value here is read as-is from the frozen V4
snapshot. "Team 0"/"Team 1" internal indices are UNCHANGED -- only the
user-facing TEXT/COLOR is Team A (green) / Team B (gold-yellow).

# Pressing Team Timeline). SUPERSEDES the 2026-09-09 per-frame
# `dominant_state`/`dominant_team` sampling approach (audit finding:
# `dominant()` requires the pair's SINGLE highest-rank state to
# literally equal PRESS_FORMING/ACTIVE_PRESS at that EXACT sampled
# frame, which only overlaps a small fraction of a real episode's own
# [onset_time, end_time] window -- producing thin per-frame spikes
# rather than the real detected episode's actual duration). The
# correct source, per this round's own audit, is `pressing_v4.
# build_pressing_v4`'s own `episodes` list (`onset_time`/`end_time`,
# already real, already detected, UNCHANGED FSM/threshold logic) --
# used DIRECTLY here, not re-derived from per-frame state samples.
#
#   +1 = Team A Pressing  <- t falls within a REAL Team A episode's own [onset_time, end_time]
#   -1 = Team B Pressing  <- t falls within a REAL Team B episode's own [onset_time, end_time]
#    0 = No Clear Press   <- t falls in NEITHER team's episode window, OR
#         (genuinely important) falls within BOTH simultaneously -- a
#         real overlap between a Team A and a Team B episode is treated
#         as CONTESTED/unresolved and mapped to neutral, never guessed
#         toward either side.
#
# Each episode contributes ONLY its own real [onset_time, end_time]
# span -- separate episodes are NEVER stitched together, gaps between
# episodes are NEVER filled, and no episode is ever extended past its
# own real `end_time` (the FSM's own `last_observed_frame`).
#
# AUDIT FINDING (disclosed, not hidden): on this real 120s clip, EVERY
# one of the 19 real episodes has a genuinely short duration -- from 0ms
# (a single-frame onset+immediate termination) up to a maximum of 200ms
# (6 frames, episode `T0-957`). Switching from per-frame sampling to
# real episode intervals is still the semantically CORRECT fix (it now
# honors the FSM's own detected boundaries exactly, rather than an
# approximation reconstructed from `dominant()`'s frame-level picks),
# but it does NOT make this clip's timeline look dramatically less
# sparse -- the underlying episodes really are this short. Manufacturing
# wider blocks would misrepresent the real data and is explicitly

# 2026-09-10 -- COACH-MODE Graph 2 ONLY. AUDIT FINDING: `_plot_line`
# (above, UNCHANGED, still used by `draw_dual_graph` for research mode)
# already draws a real `raw_score == 0.0` sample correctly -- verified
# directly (the pickled snapshot's zero/None counts match a fresh
# `build_pressing_v4` run exactly, and a real zero-containing window
# rendered through the UNMODIFIED `_plot_line` does paint pixels all
# the way down to the y=0 gridline). There is NO data-suppression bug.
# The real problem is purely visual: a flat run of zeros is a bare 3px
# line sitting exactly on the panel's own bottom border/gridline row,
# easy to mis-read as "nothing plotted here" rather than "a real
# measured zero". `_plot_line_with_markers` adds a small filled circle
# at EVERY real sample (valid zeros included) -- purely a rendering
# change, computed from the exact same gap-aware, causal filtering
# `_plot_line` already uses (never re-derived differently) -- so a
# zero-run reads as a visible row of dots instead of a hairline. Used
# ONLY by `draw_dual_graph_coach` below; `_plot_line`/`draw_dual_graph`
# (research mode) are completely untouched.

Pressing-structure analytics (Project 1) -- reusable, project-scoped to
`pressing_structure/` only. Builds on:
  - `pressing_structure.analytics.cleaned_tracking_view` (this project's
    own cleaned/segmented positions -- see that module's docstring)
  - `analytics.possession` (EXISTING PhD module, REUSED UNCHANGED --
    ball-carrier identity is never re-invented here; if the PhD
    possession model says UNCERTAIN/FREE_BALL/BALL_LOST, this module
    honors that and does not compute pressing features for that frame)
  - `analytics.pitch_control` (EXISTING PhD module, REUSED UNCHANGED --
    "pitch-control advantage around the ball" samples the SAME
    time-to-intercept surface already built and QA'd for the main
    dashboard, not a new model)
  - `outputs/analytics/testVideo1_120s_v3/{passes,turnovers}.parquet`
    (EXISTING, CANONICAL, DERIVED data -- read-only, used only to decide
    a press's OUTCOME; no new pass/turnover detection logic here)

See `pressing_structure/docs/METHODOLOGY.md` for exact definitions,
thresholds, and what is explicitly NOT implemented in this first pass.

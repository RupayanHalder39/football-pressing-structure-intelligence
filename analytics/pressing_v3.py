"""
Pressing V3: SIMULTANEOUS dual-team press tracking with a proper
transition-aware (hysteresis) state machine, replacing the old
single-perspective "is a press active right now" binary trigger with
independent, continuously-scored states for BOTH teams every frame.

NEW module. Does not modify `pressing_structure/analytics/pressing.py`
-- reuses its existing, unmodified `build_pressing_features` (raw
per-frame nearest-defender-distance / closing-speed / presser-count
features) and `SUCCESSFUL_PRESS_STATES` read-only. The V2 outcome
taxonomy (BALL_REGAIN/FORCED_BACKWARD/...) and episode detector in
pressing.py are UNCHANGED and still used elsewhere; this module adds a
different, complementary signal (continuous per-team press intensity
+ stable state), not a replacement for the outcome classifier.

## Why a per-team raw score, not a single "is anyone pressing" score

A team can only be "pressing" while the OTHER team has the ball --
that's the real football definition already encoded in
`build_pressing_features` (pressers are always drawn from the
non-carrier team). So `press_score_team0` and `press_score_team1` are
computed EVERY frame, but only one of them can be non-zero at a time:
- if team 1 has the ball this frame: `press_score_team0` = the real,
  disclosed pressing-intensity combo below; `press_score_team1` = 0.0
  (team 1 cannot press while their own team has the ball -- a real,
  defined zero, not a guess).
- vice versa if team 0 has the ball.
- if no confident carrier exists this frame: BOTH scores are None (no
  evidence, not zero) -- carried through the smoothing/FSM step as
  "UNCERTAIN" rather than silently treated as "no press".

## Raw score formula (disclosed, simple, NOT fit to any outcome)

    raw = clip(0.40 * norm(n_pressers_5m,      0,   4)
             + 0.35 * norm(closing_speed_cm_s, 0, 300)
             + 0.25 * (1 - norm(nearest_defender_distance_cm, 0, 800)),
               0, 1)

Weights are round numbers chosen to reflect (in order) how many
players are closing in, how fast the nearest one is closing, and how
tight the nearest gap already is -- not tuned against any label.

## Stabilization

`smooth_scores()` + `run_fsm()` (both in the shared
`pressing_structure.analytics.state_machine` module) turn the raw
per-frame score into one of NO_PRESS / PRESS_FORMING / ACTIVE_PRESS /
PRESS_ENDING / UNCERTAIN per team, with hysteresis thresholds and
minimum hold/cooldown durations documented in `PRESS_FSM_CONFIG`
below -- see that module's docstring for exactly what each parameter
does. `press_confidence_teamX(f)` is simply the smoothed score itself
(already in [0,1], already real) -- not a separate invented quantity.

## Dominant/display state decision

`decide_dominant_state()` implements the brief's exact rule: one team
clearly active -> show that team; both low -> NO_PRESS; both
active/forming simultaneously (only possible right at a
possession-change boundary, since only the non-carrier team can score
above zero in steady state) -> CONTESTED; anything else -> UNCERTAIN.
